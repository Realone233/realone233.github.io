### A letter to you written by *Realone*

**Dear *friends*,**  
	I am Realone, a senior high student. Thank you browsing our blog. If you like the blog enough and want to make it better, it is no problem, because we really need your help. Before that, we should explain why we need you.  
	First, only few pages which are active in our blog. We know that there are several people even none would browse these pages. But we still want to create more pages for everybody or just for ourselves which recorded our experience, shared our stories and so on. Although that, there are only few things could be recorded. In a word, we couldn't create more pages almost. If you could help us, then the problem is gone.   
	Besides, our experience is poor and not enough. It means that we are not able to edit notes or articles more valuable or professional. Enriching our experience together is also important. The last but not least, the more people join us, the more active we are. And we will be delighted to meet you.  
	All that, if you really want to be a member of us, we can share our experience together, help each other, write our stories and so on. You can send emails to me `AECVP@outlook.com` or chat in our group `https://t.me/RealoneInBox`. We will reply to you as soon as possible and tell you that more details about it.  
	Thanks a lot. Hope you can have a good time.
